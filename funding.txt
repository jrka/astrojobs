# Research funding for astronomy
# Based on right hand side of Table 1 from Metcalfe 2008 http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/528878
#   ... which goes through 2004
# Reported as ACTUAL dollar amounts in M$.

#     Table 1A: Federal obligations for total research, by detailed field of science & engineering: All agencies, fiscal years 1970-2003
#         Category: Physical sciences --> Astronomy (First column, Total)
#     Table 1K: Federal obligations for total research, by detailed field of science & engineering: National Aeronautics & Space Administration, fiscal years 1970-2003

#     Table 1L: Federal obligations for total research, by detailed field of science & engineering: National Science Foundation, fiscal years 1970-2003	
# Unfortunately, subsequent data appears to be in groups of 3 years. 
# "Historically, the Federal funds data are collected annually for 3 government fiscal years at a time: the fiscal year just completed, the current fiscal year, and the next fiscal year. Actual data are collected for the year just completed; estimates are obtained for the current and next fiscal year. "
# https://nsf.gov/statistics/srvyfedfunds/#tabs-2 or more likely https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/federal-funds-research-development/ (which will auto-port you to the most recent year)
# For each year, go to "Total Researchâ€”Agency, Performer, and Field of Science and Engineering"
# Then for "Total" astronomy data, "Federal obligations for research, by detailed field of science and engineering: " (Table 19 for 2003-2005 and on)
# For "NASA" and "NSF" fields, go to "Federal obligations for research in environmental and physical sciences, by agency and detailed field:" (Table 23 for 2003-2005 through 2010-2013)
# Starting in 2011, "Federal obligations for research in physical sciences, by agency and detailed field: ", Now Table 27
# and choose the column for that agency corresponding to "Astronomy"
# Starting in 2016, the tables we need are now 16 and 36. There were several format changes, so sometimes you need to re-load the original link, and the tables jump around a lot... But near 16 and 36 should be okay. Sometimes you have to download a PDF.
# Starting in 2010 an extra decimal place was reported; this has been rounded.
